We are submitting the following files: 
RS.v
RS_test.v
RS.tcl

RS.v contains the module for our Reservation Station. This is the first major component/module which we implemented for the first milestone. 
RS_test.v is the testbench that tests for the reservation station module. The module is named RS. 
RS.tcl is the script that synthesizes our reservation station. 

From the root directory, you can perform the following operations:
"make" --> create simv executable that runs the testbench without synthesis to check for behavior
"make syn" --> synthesize the RS module and run the testbench across the synthesized module
