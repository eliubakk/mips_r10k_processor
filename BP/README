-------------------Things have done
Random and for-loop testing
2 bit saturation counter
8 entry 2 bit saturation counter PHT (synthesized) 
	(9T1N loop : 90%, random test : 76%)
Global per PC counter(GAS) (synthesized) 
	(9T1N loop : 78%, random test : 48% @ 4 GHT bit, 2 bit per PC)
	(9T1N loop : 97%, random test : 49% @ 10 GHT bit, 2 bit per PC)
	(9T1N loop : 91%, random test : 49% @ 10 GHT bit, 4 bit per PC)
BTB(synthesized)
GSHARE(Synthesized) : Need to do the testing
Speculate update of GHT and roll back(synthesized) 
-------------------Things to do left


**Big branch predictor module

Tournament predictor
Test which predictor is the best (Different predictor / predictor 1bit vs 2bit /GHT and PHT size (GHT bit and per PC entry )

+ prefetcher, icache
